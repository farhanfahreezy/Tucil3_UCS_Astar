Have you ever played a game where you have to find your way out of a maze? Well, in computer science, we have to solve that same problem using algorithms. Two popular algorithms for solving mazes are Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). And in this project, we'll be using C# and .NET Framework to develop our own maze solver using both BFS and DFS algorithms.

Our goal with this maze solver is to find a path that will lead us to all the treasures hidden within the maze. BFS is like searching the maze level by level, while DFS is more like exploring a particular path as far as we can before backtracking and trying another path. It's going to be a fun project, and we can't wait to see our maze solver in action!
